# go-zero Skills for AI Agents

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

This repository contains structured knowledge and patterns for AI coding assistants to help developers work effectively with the [go-zero](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero) framework.

## Purpose

These materials are optimized for AI agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to:
- Generate accurate go-zero code following framework conventions
- Provide context-aware suggestions and completions
- Help developers follow best practices
- Troubleshoot common issues
